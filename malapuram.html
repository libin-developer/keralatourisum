            Keralamkund is the first tourism center in Malappuram district to be included in the national adventure tourism map. It is situated at the foothills of Kumpanmala, at an altitude of 1350 feet above sea level in shadow of the Western Ghats.[4] The waterfall is formed by the confluence of streams flowing through various tributaries on the mountain. The climate is cool and the region is home to rare species of flora and fauna.[5] The area is also considered as a danger zone as it has led to death of some people.[6] The Natmug Valley, which has castor plantations is nearly a kilometer from here. Karuvarakund, a recreation areas are also a major hub for young people is located 7 km from here.[7] The Cherumb eco village is also located near to Keralamkund waterfalls.

                Since the summers and the monsoons are both not ideal for trekking your way into these waterfalls, the best time to go here would probably be from November to March. Depending on your ability to cope with the heat, you can also pay a visit in the month of April.
