The port at Kozhikode acted as the gateway to medieval South Indian coast for the Chinese, the Persians, the Arabs and finally the Europeans.[13] According to data compiled by economics research firm Indicus Analytics in 2009 on residences, earnings and investments, Kozhikode was ranked the second-best city in India to live in.[14] In November 2023, Kozhikode became the first Indian city to be included in the list of Creative Cities Network (UCCN) by UNESCO.
