            Alappuzha or Alleppey  is the administrative headquarters of Alappuzha district in state of Kerala, India. The Backwaters of Alappuzha are one of the most popular tourist attractions in India which attracts millions of domestic and international tourists.[3]

Alleppey is a city and a municipality in Kerala with an urban population of 174,164[4] and ranks third among the districts in literacy rate in the state. In 2016, the Centre for Science and Environment rated Alappuzha as the cleanest town in India.[5] Alappuzha is considered to be the oldest planned city in this region and the lighthouse built on the coast of the city is the first of its kind along the Laccadive Sea coast.[6]

The city is 55 km from Kochi and 155 km north of Thiruvananthapuram.A town with canals, backwaters, beaches, and lagoons, Alappuzha was described by George Curzon, Viceroy of India at the start of the 20th century, as the "Venice of the East."[8] Hence, it is known as the "Venetian Capital" of Kerala.
It is an important tourist destination in India.[9] It connects Kumarakom and Cochin to the North and Kollam to the South. It is also the access point for the annual Nehru Trophy Boat Race, held on the Punnamada Lake, near Alappuzha, on the second Saturday of August every year. This is amongst the most popular and competitive boat races in India.

It also includes interconnected lakes, rivers, and inlets, a labyrinthine system formed by more than 900 km (560 mi) of waterways, and sometimes compared to bayous.[3] The network includes five large lakes linked by canals, both man made and natural, fed by 38 rivers, and extending virtually half the length of Kerala state. The backwaters were formed by the action of waves and shore currents creating low barrier islands across the mouths of the many rivers flowing down from the Western Ghats range. In the midst of this landscape there are a number of towns and cities, which serve as the starting and end points of backwater cruises.[4] There are 34 backwaters in Kerala.[5] Out of it, 27 are located either closer to Arabian Sea or parallel to the sea.[5] The remaining 7 are inland navigation routes.

                National Waterway 3 from Kollam to Kottappuram, covers a distance of 205 km (127 mi) and runs almost parallel to the coastline of southern Kerala facilitating both cargo movement and backwater tourism.[6] Vembanad is the largest of the lakes, covering an area of 2,033 km2 (785 sq mi). The lake has a large network of canals that meander through the region of Kuttanad. The important rivers from north to south are the Valapattanam 110 km (68 mi), Chaliyar 169 km (105 mi), Kadalundipuzha 130 km (81 mi), Bharathappuzha 209 km (130 mi), Chalakudy 130 km (81 mi), Periyar 244 km (152 mi), Pamba 176 km (109 mi), Achankovil 128 km (80 mi), Meenachil 75 km (47 mi), and Kalladayar 121 km (75 mi). Other than these, there are 35 more small rivers and rivulets flowing down from the Ghats. Most of these rivers are navigable up to the midland region, in country crafts.

                Vembanad Lake is the longest backwater in Kerala, as well as the longest lake in India.[5] The Kochi city, Kuttanad, Kumarakom, and Pathiramanal Island are located in this long backwater.[5] The Vellayani Lake, the Pookode Lake, and the Sasthamcotta Lake are the freshwater lakes in Kerala.[5] Sasthamcotta is the largest among them.[5] The Kerala backwaters host three of the world’s Ramsar Convention-listed wetlands: Ashtamudi Lake, Sasthamkotta Lake, and the Vembanad-Kol wetlands are noted as being wetlands of international importance.

                The Kettuvallam were traditionally used as grain barges, to transport the rice harvested in the fertile fields alongside the backwaters. Thatched roof covers over wooden hulls, 100 ft (30 m) in length, providing protected from the elements. At some point in time, the boats were used as living quarters by the royalty. Converted to accommodate tourists, the houseboats have become floating cottages having a sleeping area, with western-style toilets, a dining area and a sit out on the deck. Most tourists spend the night on a houseboat. Food is cooked on board by the accompanying staff—mostly having a flavour of Kerala. The houseboats are of various patterns and can be hired as per the size of the family or visiting group. The living-dining room is usually open on at least three sides providing a grand view of the surroundings, including other boats, throughout the day when it is on the move. It is brought to a standstill at times of taking food and at night. After sunset, the boat crew provide burning coils to drive away mosquitoes. Ketuvallam are motorised but generally proceed at a slow speed for smooth travel. All Ketuvallam have a generator and most bedrooms are air-conditioned. At times, as per the demand of customers, electricity is switched off and lanterns are provided to create a rural setting[6][7]
